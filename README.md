# VBAOutlookSortDomains
Sorts outlook emails by domain and then makes a rule for each one to filter received emails to the appropriate folder

(NEEDS WORK STILL. Currently duplicates rules for each email.)


Made this Module that creates a domain folder for highlighted emails and sorts them appropriately

In this case there are some filtered out that won't sort.
